To get started simply copy everything from here into the source directory

```
cp -r contrib/ide/clion/keyvi/.idea keyvi
cp -r contrib/ide/clion/pykeyvi/.idea pykeyvi

```

Start Clion and open the project at keyvi/keyvi. After build all cmake targets shall be there. Python targets must be created manually according to your preferences(python interpreter, virtualenv, ...).
